WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net icon_control0<13> is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <uart/ut/ut/txData<0>> is incomplete.
   The signal does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:781 - PULLUP on an active net. PULLUP of comp
   Debug_out_PULLUP is set but the tri state is not configured. 
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:781 - PULLUP on an active net. PULLUP of comp
   LED_Out_PULLUP is set but the tri state is not configured. 
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2410 - This design is using one or more 9K Block RAMs
   (RAMB8BWER).  9K Block RAM initialization data, both user defined and
   default, may be incorrect and should not be used.  For more information,
   please reference Xilinx Answer Record 39999.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
